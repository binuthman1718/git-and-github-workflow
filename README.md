# Git and GitHub Workflow Project

This project is designed to provide a clear and practical understanding of how to use **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for remote collaboration.  
It walks through the complete workflow ‚Äî from setting up a repository to managing branches, ignoring unnecessary files, and applying an open-source license.

## üìå Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand the fundamentals of Git (init, add, commit, branch, merge).
- Learn how to connect a local repository with GitHub.
- Practice pushing and pulling changes between local and remote repositories.
- Use branching to manage new features or bug fixes.
- Apply `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean from system or temporary files.
- Add a license to clarify permissions for using and sharing the project.

## üöÄ Git & GitHub Workflow Steps
This project follows a typical Git and GitHub workflow:

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a local Git repository.
   - Link it with a remote GitHub repository.
   - Add essential files like `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `LICENSE`.

2. **Making Changes**
   - Edit files or add new features.
   - Stage changes using `git add`.
   - Save changes permanently using `git commit`.

3. **Syncing with GitHub**
   - Push local commits to GitHub using `git push`.
   - Pull updates from GitHub using `git pull`.

4. **Branching Workflow**
   - Create a new branch for a feature: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
   - Work on the branch independently.
   - Merge the branch back into `main` when the feature is complete.

5. **Collaboration**
   - Multiple developers can clone the repository.
   - Use pull requests (PRs) on GitHub to review and merge changes.
