# Git and GitHub Workflow Project

 Git and Github project workflow with detailed explanation

This project is designed to provide a clear and practical understanding of how to use **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for remote collaboration.  
It walks through the complete workflow ‚Äî from setting up a repository to managing branches, ignoring unnecessary files, and applying an open-source license.  

---

## üìå Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand the fundamentals of Git (init, add, commit, branch, merge).
- Learn how to connect a local repository with GitHub.
- Practice pushing and pulling changes between local and remote repositories.
- Use branching to manage new features or bug fixes.
- Apply `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean from system or temporary files.
- Add a license to clarify permissions for using and sharing the project.

## üöÄ Git & GitHub Workflow Steps
This project follows a typical Git and GitHub workflow:

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create a local Git repository.
   - Link it with a remote GitHub repository.
   - Add essential files like `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `LICENSE`.

2. **Making Changes**
   - Edit files or add new features.
   - Stage changes using `git add`.
   - Save changes permanently using `git commit`.

3. **Syncing with GitHub**
   - Push local commits to GitHub using `git push`.
   - Pull updates from GitHub using `git pull`.

4. **Branching Workflow**
   - Create a new branch for a feature: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
   - Work on the branch independently.
   - Merge the branch back into `main` when the feature is complete.

5. **Collaboration**
   - Multiple developers can clone the repository.
   - Use pull requests (PRs) on GitHub to review and merge changes.

## üìÇ Files in this Repository
- **README.md** ‚Üí Explains the purpose, workflow, and usage of the project.
- **.gitignore** ‚Üí Excludes system files, logs, caches, and environment files from Git tracking.
- **LICENSE** ‚Üí Defines how others can use and share this project.
- *(Future files may include scripts, examples, or documentation.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Git** ‚Üí For version control and tracking changes.
- **GitHub** ‚Üí For hosting the repository and enabling collaboration.
- **VS Code** ‚Üí For editing files and managing Git operations.

=======
This project demonstrates the Git and GitHub workflow for version control and collaboration.  
It explains how to:
- Initialize and manage repositories
- Commit and push changes
- Use branches for new features
- Work with `.gitignore` and licenses
## üåø Branching Strategy

In this project, we are using the **GitHub Flow** workflow.

- The `main` branch is always stable.  
- For every new change, we create a **feature branch**.  
- After finishing the work, we push the branch to GitHub.  
- Then we create a **Pull Request (PR)** and merge it into `main`.  

### Example:
```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature-update-readme

# Make changes, then save them
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with branching strategy"

# Push branch to GitHub
git push origin feature-update-readme
